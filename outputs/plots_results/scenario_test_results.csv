Scenario Name,Input Details,Our Intent (Why?),Model Probability,Final Prediction,Student Conclusion
Scenario 1: The 'Rich User' Test,"Amount: $25,000 | Time: 14:00 (Afternoon) | Features: Normal","We want to check: Does the model flag a transaction just because the amount is huge? We hope NOT, because rich people also use credit cards.",0.7930,🚨 FRAUD DETECTED,Fail. The model is too sensitive to high amounts.
Scenario 2: The 'Insomniac' Test,Amount: $15.50 | Time: 03:00 AM (Night) | Features: Normal,We want to check: Does the model panic just because it's night time? Buying a snack at 3 AM shouldn't be fraud.,0.3421,✅ Normal Transaction,Good. The model knows that night transactions can be safe.
Scenario 3: The 'Hacker' Attack,"Amount: $5,000 | Time: 04:00 AM | V14 & V4: Highly Abnormal",We manipulated V14 and V4 (based on our Feature Importance charts). This simulates a card being used in a weird location or device. We expect a FRAUD alert.,0.9972,🚨 FRAUD DETECTED,Perfect! The model caught the complex pattern hidden in V-features.
